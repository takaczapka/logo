1) clearscreen = cs - is a combination of "clean" and "home" commands

2) repcount - is a current interation counter used in repeat or forever
    i.e. repeat 10 [ show repcount ]

3) animation routine pseudocode is following:

  clearscreen	
  forever/repeat [
    move_position
    draw_frame
    wait 1
    clean
  ]

4) "move_position" should be absolute - it shouldn't matter where "draw_frame" finished. It might take "repcount" or other parameter(s).

	TO move_position :iteration
	  home      ; reset the position
	  rt :itearation * 2
	END

5) "draw_frame" cannot use absolute moves, so "home" or "setxy" are not allowed

6) circles render in animation much better than any other figures (jslogo is just slow)
 (check circles-rotating-*.logo examples)
